\subsection{Decentral Decisions}

Now that we know, that we can reach any point on the production frontier by
maximizing the scalar product with regards to some price \(p\), we want to
use the linearity of the support function with regards to Minkowski sums to
decentralize the decision making.
So here is all the magic
\[
	\sup_{y\in X}\langle p, y\rangle
	= \mu(p, X)
	= \mu\Bigl(p, \sum_{i=1}^n X_i\Bigr)
	\overset{\text{linear}}= \sum_{i=1}^n \mu(p, X_i)
	= \sum_{i=1}^n \sup_{y\in X_i} \langle p, y\rangle.
\]
So each individual can solve their own maximization problem (maximize their
income) and the end result will be the same as if you had maximized over total
production \(X\).
