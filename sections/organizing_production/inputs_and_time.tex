\subsection{Inputs and Time}
\label{sec: inputs and time}

We have not considered possible material inputs needed for production so far.
The only input necessary was time. But people typically do not build things
completely from the ground up. A different person typically gathers materials
than the person who uses them in production. So we need to model inputs. If we
allow \(X_i\) to be outside of \(\real_{\ge 0}^\dims\), negative entries
represent the consumption of some good for production.

\subsubsection{Variable Cost Production with Inputs}

Let us now consider a specific example. 
\[
	h_{\cdot k} = (h_{1k},\dots, h_{\dims k})\]
is production method \(k\). Completing one cycle of production results in the
production of \(h_{jk}\) units of good \(j\). If \(h_{jk}\) is negative, this
was an input. Typically most entries are zero, some are negative and one is
positive. Let \(v = (v_k)_{k\le m}\) denote the number of production cycles for
each production method. Then for \(H=(h_{jk})_{j\le\dims,k\le m}\) our total
production is given by
\[
	x = Hv.
\]
Let \(l_i^{(k)}\) denote the labour requirements of person \(i\) to complete
one cycle of production method \(k\). Then their production capabilities are
given by
\[
	X_i = \low(\{ Hv : v\in \real_{\ge 0}^\dims, \langle v, l_i\rangle \le L_i\}).
\]
where \(\low(M):=\{x\in \real^{\dims}: \exists y\in M,\; x\precsim y\}\) denotes
the smallest set containing \(M\) which is a \ref{eq: lower layer}. If one does
not want to allow partial production cycles, one could also require
\(v\in\nat^\dims\). Although this would result in a difficult unbounded
Knapsack problem once we state the income maximization problem
\[
	\mu(p, X_i)	= \sup_{y\in X_i} \langle y, p\rangle.
\]
The greedy approach to the Knapsack problem
would convert this problem back into the continuous case, which we can solve
explicitly as follows:

\begin{lemma}[Income in Variable Cost Production with Inputs Case]
	For reasonable prices \(p\in \real_{\ge 0}^\dims\), we have
	\[
		\mu(p, X_i)
		= L_i \max_{j=1,\dots,d}
		\underbrace{\frac{(H^T p)_k}{l_i^{(k)}}}_{=:w_i^{(k)}}
		= L_i \underbrace{\|w_i\|_\infty}_{\text{wage}}.
	\]
	\((H^T p)_k\) is the net profit of production method \(k\) before labour
	costs. In other words, revenue from the sale of outputs minus cost of inputs.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	We can assume without loss of generality
	\[
		X_i = \{ Hv : v\in \real_{\ge 0}^\dims, \langle v, l_i\rangle \le L_i\},
	\]
	as the income from any \(y\precsim x\) with \(x\in X_i\) is lower or equal
	to the income from \(x\). Then we have
	\[\begin{aligned}
		\mu(p, X_i)
		&= \sup\{
			\langle Hv, p\rangle :
			v\in \real_{\ge 0}^\dims,\; \langle v, l_i\rangle \le L_i
		\}\\
		&= \sup\{
			\langle v, H^T p\rangle :
			v\in \real_{\ge 0}^\dims,\; \langle v, l_i\rangle \le L_i
		\}
	\end{aligned}\]
	From here the proof is the same as in Lemma~\ref{lem: income in the pure variable cost case}
	using \(H^T p\) in place of \(p\).
\end{proof}

Adding fixed costs \(f^{(k)}_i\) to enable production method \(k\) for person
\(i\) is a similarly straightforward generalization from Lemma~\ref{lem: income
in mixed case} resulting in average costs \(\bar{l}_i^{(k)}\). These fixed cost
could represent learning the method. Ideally one would want two different fixed
costs. One for coming up with the method yourself is much higher than the one
with a teacher. But this model is unfortunately not well suited for trading
information, which can be copied with significantly smaller effort
than its first creation. Research would also need to be stochastic.

This is where this model breaks down, and probably also where the efficiency
guarantees break.
