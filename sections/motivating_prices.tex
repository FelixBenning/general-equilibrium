\section{Motivating Prices}

Let \(X_i = X_i(L_i)\) be the set of possible production vectors of person \(i\)
under labour constraint \(L_i\).
\begin{example}[Pure Variable Costs]
	One important special case is
	\[
		X_i = \{ x \in \real_{\ge 0}^\dims: \langle x, l_i \rangle \le L_i \}.
	\]
	Here \(l_i^{(j)}\ge0\) is the labour time required by person \(i\) to produce one
	unit of good \(j\). Therefore the total time spent to produce quantity
	\(x^{(j)}\) of good \(j\) is \(x^{(j)}l_i^{(j)}\). Summing over all goods
	results in the total time requirement
	\[
		L_i(x) = \sum_{j=1}^\dims x^{(j)}l_i^{(j)} = \langle x, l_i\rangle,
	\]
	which obviously needs to be smaller than our time constraint \(L_i\).

	One could easily model exhaustion with \(L_i(x) = g(\langle x, l_i\rangle)\)
	for some strictly monotonously increasing function \(g\).
\end{example}

\begin{example}[Hermit Economy with Pure Variable Costs]
	A hermit faces the utility function maximization problem
	\[
		\max_{x} u(\overbrace{1-L_i(x)}^{\text{free time}}, x).
	\]
	Denoting the partial derivative with regard to free time as \(u_f\) and the
	gradient vector with regard to \(x\) as \(u_x\), the first
	order condition for maximization requires
	\[
		0\overset!=\frac{du}{dx}
		= u_x - \nabla L_i(x) u_f
		= u_f \Bigl[
			\underbrace{\frac{u_x}{u_f}}_{\mathclap{\text{willingness to work (wtw)}}}
		- \overbrace{\nabla L_i(x)}^{\mathclap{\text{natural prices}}}
		\Bigr],
	\]
	where we can assume the marginal utility of more free time \(u_f\) to be
	positive. The natural prices are simply {\color{lightgray} a multiple of}
	\(l_i\)
	\[
		\nabla L_i(x) = {\color{lightgray} g'(\langle x, l_i\rangle) }l_i.
	\]
	In other words: the price of good \(j\), is the {\color{lightgray} marginal}
	time required to produce \(j\). And without exhaustion this is simply
	\(l^{(j)}_i\). If the willingness to work for good \(j\) is smaller than
	its price, then our gradient is negative in this direction. Meaning that
	a reduction of \(x_j\) would increase our utility.
\end{example}
