\subsection{Supply and Demand}

Before we move on, let us quickly define supply and demand. The demand of
individual \(i\) is given by
\[
	D_i(p) := \{
		y : (L,y)
		\text{ is a solution to \eqref{eq: individual decision problem}}
	\}.
\]
Notice that it is a set, since there might be multiple solutions. The same is
true for the supply of individual \(i\)
\[
	S_i(p) := \argmax_{x\in X_i} \langle p, x\rangle 
	\overset{(*)}= \nabla_p \mu(p, X_i).
\]
Where \((*)\) is a property of the support function \(\mu(\cdot,
X_i)\)\fxnote{source or explanation}.
We can then define total demand and supply
\[
	D(p) := \sum_{i=1}^n D_i(p),
	\qquad
	S(p) := \sum_{i=1}^n S_i(p),
\]
where the sums are Minkowski sums.
And \(p^*\) is a market equilibrium, if
\[
	S(p^*)\cap D(p^*)\neq\emptyset.
\]
If \(S(p^*)\) and \(D(p^*)\) only contain a single element, one may write
\(S(p^*)=D(p^*)\).
